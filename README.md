# Procedural-Tactics
This is a subject that I've tried tackling before, but wasn't able to before learning Unity. Previously, game engine and code extensibility limitations were major road blocks for this type of project, but now I've managed to create a working prototype of a space survival tactics game with simple procedural generation and other roguelike elements. Credit for the skybox goes to TL Multimedia and for the textures to Mauricio Marinho.
